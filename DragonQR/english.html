            <p>Welcome to The Dragon QR! Developer of The Dragon QR (“we”, “us”, or “our”) has prepared this Privacy
                Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Information (as defined below) we collect
                from users of our website, located at http://www.ouqiejia.com/erweima.html (the “Website”) and any
                related online services (“Services”).</p>
            <p>So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase “Personal Information” in this
                Privacy Policy, we mean information that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for
                example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public
                information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing information. When we use
                the phrase “Anonymous Information” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that is not associated
                with or linked to your Personal Information. Anonymous Information does not enable identification of or
                contact with individual persons.</p>
            <p>A Note to Users Outside of China. If you are a non-Chinese user of the Website or Services, by visiting
                the Website and/or providing us with information, you acknowledge and agree that your Personal
                Information may be processed for the purposes identified in the Privacy Policy. In addition, your
                Personal Information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries,
                including China, where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the
                laws in your country. By providing your information, you consent to such transfer.
            </p>
            <p>How We Collect Information</p>
            <p>Personal Information: In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to provide the Services
                to you and helps us learn more about the use of the Website and/or Services. We collect Personal
                Information that you submit to us voluntarily at registration and in the course of your use of the
                Website and/or Services, including when you communicate with us or when you request a white paper from
                us.</p>
            <p>Anonymous Information:We collect the following types of Anonymous Information:
            </p>
            <p>Information Collected by Our Servers
            </p>
            <p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. Our
                servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including
                but not limited to your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number that
                is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to
                session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit, clickstream data and referring/exit
                pages. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Website, track users’ movements around
                the Website, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our
                Website and Services to our users’ needs.</p>
            <p>Cookies</p>
            <p>Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “Cookies” are small pieces of
                information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may
                use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which
                stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive
                experience on our Services. This type of information is collected to make the Services more useful to
                you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. If you decide at any
                time that you no longer wish to accept cookies from our Service for any of the purposes described above,
                then you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you
                before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Consult your browser’s technical information. If
                you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Website or all
                functionality of the Website.</p>
            <p>Disclosure – Third Party Cookies
            </p>
            <p>We may use a third party tracking service such as Google Analytics to track and analyze Anonymous
                Information from users of our Services. Such third parties may use Cookies to help track user behavior.
                The use of these Cookies by third parties is not covered by our Privacy Policy. We do not have access or
                control over these Cookies. For example, Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you
                on the date you visit the Services, rather than your name or other personally identifying information.
                We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with your personal
                information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as
                a unique user the next time you visit the Services, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.
                Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the
                Services is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>How We Use Information</p>
            <p>Personal Information
            </p>
            <p>We will use your Personal Information to:Provide you with the Website and Services;
                Market to you our products and services (and those of third parties) that we believe may interest you
                and to permit third parties to offer such products and services to you;
                Tailor the content and features of the Website or Services to you;
                Respond to your requests, resolve disputes and/or troubleshoot problems;
                Improve the quality of the Website and the Services; and
                Communicate with you about the Website and the Services.
                We may also use your Personal Information to create Anonymous Information records by excluding
                information that makes the information personally identifiable to you.</p>
            <p>Anonymous Information
            </p>
            <p>Generally, we use Anonymous Information in statistical analysis to help us analyze patterns in the use of
                our Services. We may, through our use of Cookies, collect your click-stream data, tailor web content to
                you and personalize your experience on the Website. We may also use your Anonymous Information to
                improve our internal operations, notify visitors of updates to our Website and Services, and software
                and customize the content and layout of the Website and/or Service.</p>
            <p>How We Disclose Information</p>
            <p>Personal Information:To third parties to whom you ask us to send Personal Information;
                To third party vendors who help us provide the Services or the Website;
                To a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control
                (collectively, “Affiliates”), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy;
                In connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution,
                transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of
                our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Information
                may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or
                assets, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by us and will assume the rights
                and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.
                If we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) resolve disputes, investigate
                problems, or enforce our Terms of Use; (b) comply with relevant laws or to respond to requests from law
                enforcement or other government officials relating to investigations or alleged illegal activity, in
                which case we can (and you authorize us to) disclose Personal Information without subpoenas or warrants
                served on us; or (c) protect and defend our rights or property or the rights and property of you or
                third parties.</p>
            <p>Anonymous Information</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to disclose Anonymous Information publicly without restriction.</p>
            <p>Children</p>
            <p>Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. We do not collect or maintain Personal
                Information from people we actually know are under 4 years of age, and no part of our Website or
                Services is designed to attract people under 4 years of age. If we later learn that a user is under 4
                years of age, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases and to
                prevent the user from utilizing the Website and the Services.</p>
            <p>Controlling Your Information
            </p>
            <p>You can review and/or change certain of your Personal Information by emailing us at bd@ouqiejia.com. You
                authorize us to use and disclose any new or modified information that you provide in accordance with
                this Privacy Policy, and you agree that we are under no obligation to delete or modify information that
                you have previously chosen to provide us. Please remember, however, if we have already disclosed some of
                your Personal Information to third parties, we cannot access that Personal Information any longer and
                cannot force the deletion or modification of any such information by the parties to whom we have made
                those disclosures.</p>
            <p>Please note that even though you may request the deletion of your Personal Information by us, we may be
                required (by law or otherwise, such as to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, or
                enforce our Terms of Use) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a
                certain time) in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such
                requirements. When we delete Personal Information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may
                remain in our archives.</p>
            <p>Information Disclosed to Third Parties
            </p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy addresses only our use and disclosure of information we collect from and/or about you
                on the Services. If you disclose information to others, or authorize us to do the same under this
                Privacy Policy, the use and disclosure restrictions contained in this Privacy Policy will not apply to
                any third party. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the
                privacy policies of those third parties where applicable.</p>
            <p>The Website may contain content or links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us. We
                have no control over, do not review and are not responsible for the privacy policies of or content
                displayed on such other websites. When you click on such a link, you will leave our Website and go to
                another site. During this process, another entity may collect Personal Information or Anonymous
                Information from you. The Website may also contain links to other websites controlled by us but which
                operates under different privacy policies. Please review the privacy policy of any new site you visit.
            </p>
            <p>Changes to this Privacy Policy
            </p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to
